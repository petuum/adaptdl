Getting Started
---------------

AdaptDL consists of a *job scheduler* and an *adaptive training library*. They
can be used in multiple ways:

1.  Scheduling multiple training jobs on a shared Kubernetes cluster or the cloud
    (:doc:`Scheduler Installation<installation/index>`).
2.  Adapting the batch size and learning rate for a single training job
    (:doc:`Standalone Training<standalone-training>`).
3.  As a Ray Tune Trial Scheduler
    (:doc:`Tune Trial Scheduler<ray/tune_tutorial.rst>`).
4.  As a single training job running on a Ray AWS cluster
    (:doc:`Ray AWS Launcher<ray/aws_ray_adaptdl.rst>`)
